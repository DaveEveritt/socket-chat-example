# A socket.io chat example

Taken from [Get Started: Chat application](https://socket.io/get-started/chat/) on the socket.io website.

The original tutorial used JQuery, this is rewritten to use pure JavaScript.

## Notes

Socket.IO enables the sending and receiving any events required, with any data: objects that can be encoded as JSON as well as binary data.
